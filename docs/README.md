## Problems at Entrance


![problem picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-smart-door-lock/blob/main/Images/entrance.jpg)

People who use doors for the entrances face different types of problems when entering. The security level, accuracy and efficiency of the current lock system at the entrance are some major causes for the user problems. 

Therefore by this project we are developing a smart door lock including the following main features.

- Face Recognition
- Finger Print detection
- RFID card reader

In addition to them following features will be included in the smart door lock.

- Unlock record of the current user at the door
- Information display of the current user
- Allowing only one person to enter at a time
